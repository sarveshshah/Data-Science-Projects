    "You'll often be reading data from a file, or writing the output of your python scripts back into a file. Python makes this very easy. You need to open a file in the appropriate mode, using the `open` function, then you can read or write to accomplish your task. The `open` function takes two arguments, the name of the file, and the mode. The mode is a single letter string that specifies if you're going to be reading from a file, writing to a file, or appending to the end of an existing file. The function returns a file object that performs the various tasks you'll be performing: `a_file = open(filename, mode)`. The modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `'r'`: open a file for reading\n",
    "+ `'w'`: open a file for writing. Caution: this will overwrite any previously existing file\n",
    "+ `'a'`: append. Write to the end of a file. \n",
    "\n",
    "When reading, you typically want to iterate through the lines in a file using a for loop, as above. Some other common methods for dealing with files are: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ `file.read()`: read the entire contents of a file into a string\n",
    "+ `file.write(some_string)`: writes to the file, note this doesn't automatically include any new lines. Also note that sometimes writes are buffered- python will wait until you have several writes pending, and perform them all at once\n",
    "+ `file.close()`: close the open file. This will free up some computer resources occupied by keeping a file open.\n",
    "\n",
